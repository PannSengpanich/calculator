# Calculator
The Calculator project is a web development project included in The Odin Project curriculum. It is an intermediate-level project that involves building a simple calculator web application.

The goal of the project is to apply the knowledge gained in earlier lessons of the course, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create a fully-functional calculator that can perform basic mathematical operations. The Calculator project requires the use of event listeners, DOM manipulation, and JavaScript functions to create a dynamic user interface that responds to user input.

The project provides an opportunity to practice designing and styling web pages, working with JavaScript functions, and handling user events. It is a great exercise for intermediate web developers to get hands-on experience and build a practical web application that can be used for everyday calculations.
