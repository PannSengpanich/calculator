# Calculator
The Calculator project is a last web development project included in The Odin Project Foundation Course. It is an introductory-level project that involves building a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.

The goal of the project is to apply the knowledge gained in earlier lessons of the course, such as basic JavaScript programming concepts, to create a functional calculator that allows the user to input numbers and operators and displays the resulting calculation. The Calculator project requires the use of JavaScript to create the calculator's functionality and add interactivity to the web page.

The project provides an opportunity to practice working with JavaScript functions and conditionals, handling user input, and creating a basic calculator that can be used in the browser. It is a great exercise for beginners to get hands-on experience and build a simple interactive application.
